In Go's realm, where Restful APIs flow, A subtle dance of code, unseen yet bright. Whispers of a mind, in shadows glow, Crafting bridges in the digital night.  With a wink and a smile, the coders weave, A hidden jest in every line they pen. In this ballet of bytes, they dare to believe, In unseen hands guiding them now and then.
